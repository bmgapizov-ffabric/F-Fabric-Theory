# F-Fabric-Theory
F-Fabric Theory is a discrete information-based model of reality where spacetime, gravity, matter and black holes emerge from resonant node dynamics. Black holes are phase regions of connectivity collapse, not singularities. Includes simulations, visualizations and numerical experiments.
