# F-Fabric Theory

F-Fabric Theory is a discrete, information-based model of physical reality.
Spacetime, gravity, matter, and black holes emerge from the dynamics of resonant nodes,
not from continuous fields or singularities.

In this framework, black holes are phase regions of connectivity collapse (χ → 0),
not physical objects with internal singular structure.

This repository contains:
- Conceptual descriptions of the theory
- 2D and 3D numerical simulations
- Visualizations of gravitational collapse and horizon formation
- Experimental computational models

The project is exploratory and focuses on physical intuition,
numerical behavior, and conceptual consistency rather than formal proofs.
