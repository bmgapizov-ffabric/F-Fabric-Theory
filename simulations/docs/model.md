# F-Fabric Model (Concept Overview)

F-Fabric is a discrete, information-based model of physical reality.
Instead of continuous spacetime, the theory assumes a network of interacting nodes
characterized by local amplitude (A) and resonance frequency (Ω).

Connectivity between nodes is described by the dimensionless parameter:

χ = Ω_eff / A

where Ω_eff includes both local and collective (neighbor-averaged) resonance.

In this framework, gravitational collapse is modeled as a phase transition.
When χ locally drops below a critical threshold, connectivity breaks down,
leading to the emergence of a stable boundary (horizon).

Black holes are interpreted not as singular objects,
but as phase regions of collapsed connectivity.

This repository focuses on numerical experiments and visual demonstrations
of this mechanism in simplified 2D models.
